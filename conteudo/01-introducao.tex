The concept of building applications with loosely coupled services emerged in 1997 on IBM's Enterprise Java Bean (EJB). However, it was only with the REST APIs growth in the early 2010s that microservices were popularized as an established architecture for large systems requiring fast growth, continuous integration, and scalability.

As a recent software architecture style, it lacks formal knowledge and experimentation in some areas, such as its patterns and API interfaces, inter-service communication, and data management.

Extensibility is the capability of a component to extend its functionality to similar uses. An extensible system can help developers reduce work to implement new features, and architects reuse components to create simpler solutions.

Microservices can help with extensibility because of modularization and single-responsibility attached to each microservice. Allowing systems to apply extensibility only on key services for, and impact the whole architecture.

This work studies multiple microservices use cases, from a developer and architect perspective, exploring the concept of extensibility and other non-functional requirements, regarding servicesâ€™ contracts, communication, and management.
